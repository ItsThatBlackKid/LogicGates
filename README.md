# LogicGates
I didn't wanna work it out by hand so I made some python scripts to do it for me

#HOW TO USE THE CLI

##Windows 

`python logic_gates.py -[gate] [x] [y]`

where `[x]` is your first binary input and `[y]` is your second binary input

##Linux and (possibly) MacOS 

`cd /path/to/logic_gates.py/directory/`

`chmod +x logic_gates.py`

Now you can just run the command like so:
`logic_gates -[gate] [x] [y]`
